Here we go. Now remember, you'll hear it twice.
This is the engines of our ingenuity, made possible by the friends of KUHA, Houston.
Modern science learns that the mind has no sex.
The University of Houston's College of Engineering presents this series about the machines that make our civilization run,
and the people's ingenuity created them.
Marie Curie was nominated to the French Academy of Science in 1910
After heated debate, the Academy turned her down by only two votes.
That was so close that the members voted again, this time to decide whether women should ever be admitted.
Women in general fared worse than Madame Curie in particular.
She barely lost, but the Academy voted resoundingly, 90 to 52, to bar women completely.
Marie Curie won her second Nobel Prize a year later, but the French Academy stuck to its guns.
It didn't break down and had been a woman until 1979.
The English record is not much better.
Before 1945, the only woman in the British Royal Society was a skeleton in its anatomical display.
Still, modern science itself has put the question of intellectual equality under a lens.
The question arose quite naturally as science co-shaped in the 17th century.
Landa Schiebinger shows how science has twisted and turned in its struggle with the fact of female intelligence.
Some scientists thought a woman's skull wouldn't accommodate as much brain as a man's.
A 17th century woman scientist said that the female mind was too soft and cold for hard thought.
One 19th century opinion was that thought shriveled a woman's ovaries.
And you've heard the recent claims that women don't have the same access to right brain creativity that men do.
2,500 years ago, Plato argued for pure reason that all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women,
that women and men are intellectually the same.
In 1673, a Cartesian anatomist, Francois Foulin, echoed Plato.
He made an oddly unassailable statement that the mind has no sex.
His remark has haunted fatal attempts to improve mental frailty of women ever since.
Two doors opened to women in the early days of modern science.
One was Italy.
University faculties at both Padua and Bologna included distinguished women,
and for some reason about a sixth of the early German astronomers were women.
The tradition of women lecturers was an old one at Bologna, by the way.
In 1296, Meticia Gozzadini taught law there, but we're told that she lectured from behind a curtain
so her great beauty wouldn't distract students.
So we peel away the curtains that history has drawn over the women who lived the life of the mind.
What we find is a continuing presence.
When women were courted here, they emerged there.
In the end, we learn that the mind hasn't been such an easy thing to waste, after all.
